# About intakePipe
The determine the characteristics of the intake ports of piston engines sometimes is tough thing to do. To ensure a high quality gas exchange and combustion, it requies a series of calculations for various valve lifts both to determine their flow characteristics and to evaluate the ability to generate a vortex in the cylinder during the intake period. So, it is necessary to change the solid-state model of the channel for each valve lift, adjust the grid generation parameters based on it, and carry out a CFD calculation. This makes the procedure for determining the characteristics of the intake channels is time consuming.

The purpose of this work was to create a method for determining the characteristics of the intake channels of piston engines using an open integrable platform OpenFOAM, which was used to solve the problems described above. Being a really handy tool, it allows automate the process of manually changing the solid model for each valve lift!

# Usage
## Run
Directory *run/* has got three different versions of the geometry. In the *intakePipeDict* you can set some settings of the compilation (initial and finite strokes or calculation step). To start compilation of all three version run the script *AllVerRun* (which running the folowing scripts *verRun* in all *ver#/* folders). To start compilation in specified version folder run a *verRun* script in the *ver#/*. Every version folder (*ver#/*) has got a *0/* folder where you can set anything and the *geometry/*, where *.stl* files located.

The *verRun* script copies the *0/* directory, moves the valve to make the new stroke, generates the mesh and solves the case for that stroke with step. Every stroke will have its case folder *run/version#/<stroke>/* (where <stroke> is stroke in millimetres).

**Before running** the script open ParaView and load the state *case.pvsm* from *version#/0/* with ''`Load State...`''. Select *Swirl number* filter and change path to the *swirlNumberFilter.py* (the path **must** be **full**!), which is placed in *postProcessing/* directoty. Save *case.pvsm* replacing the original one with the ''`Save State...`''.

**âš  In case if you need to recompilate smth**:

Because main script runs the others if you need to recompilate something you do not need to rerun the whole project. So, if you need to recompilate:
- all calculations for a certain stroke:
    ```bash
    shopt -s extglob
    rm -r !("0"|"geometry"|"verRun")
    0/./Allclean && 0/./scaleGeometry && ./verRun
    ```
- only a certain stroke:
    ```bash
    ./Allclean && ./scaleGeometry && ./setCurrentStroke && ./Allrun
    ```

## Post-process
### Python 3
OpenFOAM post-processing functions create _postProcessing/_ folder with data files. To initiate calculation flow coeffiecients of intake pipes using .dat files run *postProcessing.py* python script (in the directory *postProcessing/flowCoefficient/*). It also considers three versions of minimal flow area (from I to III on the picture or when it moved to the *d_2* diameter).

![valveStep](https://github.com/StasF1/intakePipe/wiki/src/images/valveStep.png)

As a result we have got set of plots and one from them is a plot with flow coefficent for 3 versions of intake pipes:

![mu](https://github.com/StasF1/intakePipe/wiki/src/images/mu.png)

### ParaView
Every *version#/<stroke>/* folder has got a *caseState.pvsm* file when you open it in the ParaView with ''`LoadÂ State...`'' it calculates swirl numbers in the cylinder automatically.
